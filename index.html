    <p> 
      Today I did a better job of blocking out outside 
      distractions and I made some progress on my coding 
      project.  I built it so that users can log in and view 
      only their to-do's, and I improved the to-do input 
      method.
    </p>

    <p> 
      Right now I am going to get some rest and when I wake up,
      I will do some things for my Mom and I will work on my 
      project and go to the gym sometime tomorrow before 7 pm.
